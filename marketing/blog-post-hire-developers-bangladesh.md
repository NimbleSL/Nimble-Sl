**Weekly**
- Video call for sprint planning/review
- Demo of completed features

**Monthly**
- Review overall progress
- Discuss roadmap, priorities

### Tips for Success

1. **Over-communicate requirements** - Detailed specs prevent misunderstandings
2. **Set clear expectations** - Working hours, response times, update frequency
3. **Start small** - Begin with a small project to test the relationship
4. **Use video calls** - Builds rapport better than text
5. **Document everything** - Shared docs, recorded decisions
6. **Pay on time** - Builds trust and priority

## Legal and Payment Considerations

### Contracts

Always have a written agreement covering:
- Scope of work
- Payment terms
- IP ownership
- Confidentiality (NDA)
- Termination clause

### Payment Methods

| Method | Fees | Speed |
|--------|------|-------|
| Wise (TransferWise) | 0.5-1% | 1-2 days |
| PayPal | 3-5% | Instant |
| Payoneer | 1-2% | 1-2 days |
| Bank Wire | $25-50 flat | 3-5 days |

**Recommended**: Wise - lowest fees, fast, reliable

### IP Protection

- Include IP assignment clause in contract
- Use NDA for sensitive projects
- Bangladesh is signatory to international IP agreements

## Getting Started: Action Plan

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Define your project scope, required skills |
| 2 | Reach out to 3-5 companies/freelancers |
| 3 | Review portfolios, conduct interviews |
| 4 | Give paid test project to top 2 candidates |
| 5 | Select partner, sign contract, begin |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Choosing only on price** - Cheapest isn't best value
2. **Unclear requirements** - Leads to rework, frustration
3. **No contract** - Always have written agreement
4. **Micromanaging** - Trust your team, focus on outcomes
5. **Ignoring timezone** - Plan calls that work for both sides
6. **No test project** - Always test before committing big
