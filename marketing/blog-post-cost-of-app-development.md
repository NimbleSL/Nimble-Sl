# How Much Does It Cost to Build a Mobile App in Bangladesh? (2025 Guide)

Planning to build a mobile app? One of the first questions is: **how much will it cost?**

If you're considering Bangladesh as your development destination, you're making a smart choice. Bangladesh offers skilled developers at 40-60% lower rates than the US or UK.

In this guide, we break down the real costs of mobile app development in Bangladesh, what factors affect pricing, and how to budget your project effectively.

## Quick Cost Overview

| App Complexity | Estimated Cost | Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Simple App | $5,000 - $15,000 | 6-10 weeks |
| Medium Complexity | $15,000 - $40,000 | 10-16 weeks |
| Complex App | $40,000 - $100,000+ | 16-24+ weeks |

These are estimates for both iOS and Android using cross-platform development (Flutter/React Native). Native development for both platforms separately costs 50-80% more.

## What Determines App Development Cost?

### 1. App Complexity

**Simple Apps** ($5,000 - $15,000)
- 5-10 screens
- Basic user authentication
- Simple database
- Standard UI components
- Examples: To-do apps, basic calculators, simple catalogs

**Medium Complexity Apps** ($15,000 - $40,000)
- 10-25 screens
- User profiles and authentication
- API integrations (payment, maps, social login)
- Push notifications
- Admin panel
- Examples: E-commerce apps, booking apps, fitness trackers

**Complex Apps** ($40,000 - $100,000+)
- 25+ screens
- Real-time features (chat, video calls)
- AI/ML integration
- Complex backend logic
- Third-party integrations
- Custom animations
- Examples: Uber-like apps, social networks, fintech apps, healthcare platforms

### 2. Platform Choice

| Approach | Cost Impact | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Cross-platform (Flutter/React Native) | Base cost | Most apps, startups, MVPs |
| Native iOS only (Swift) | Same as base | iOS-exclusive apps |
| Native Android only (Kotlin) | Same as base | Android-exclusive apps |
| Native iOS + Android | +50-80% | Apps requiring maximum performance |

**Our recommendation**: Start with Flutter. It delivers near-native performance for both platforms from a single codebase, saving 30-40% compared to building two native apps.

### 3. Design Requirements

| Design Level | Cost | What You Get |
|--------------|------|--------------|
| Basic UI | Included | Standard components, clean design |
| Custom UI | +$2,000 - $5,000 | Unique design, custom components |
| Premium UI/UX | +$5,000 - $15,000 | Full UX research, prototypes, animations |

### 4. Backend Complexity

| Backend Type | Cost | Use Case |
|--------------|------|----------|
| Simple (Firebase/Supabase) | $2,000 - $5,000 | MVPs, simple apps |
| Medium (Node.js/Django) | $5,000 - $15,000 | Apps with custom logic |
| Complex (.NET/Microservices) | $15,000 - $40,000 | Enterprise apps, high-scale |

### 5. Features That Add Cost

| Feature | Additional Cost |
|---------|-----------------|
| User Authentication | $500 - $1,500 |
